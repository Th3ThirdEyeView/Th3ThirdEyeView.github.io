# 🔐 Encryptor

A fun, browser-based encryption and decryption tool made with **HTML**.  
This project is a personal experiment in building a custom encryption system — not meant for real-world security (yet 🤨👀).

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using a custom substitution key.  
- Simple UI for testing your own encoded messages.  
- Fully front-end — no servers, no data collection.  
- Works directly in your browser.

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Type your message in the input box.  
2. Click **Encrypt** to scramble it.  
3. Click **Decrypt** to bring it back.  
4. Share the encrypted output with others who have your key.
